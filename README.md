What is react-redux <br />
Just like React, Redux is also a library which is used widely for front-end development. It is basically a tool for managing both data-state and UI-state in JavaScript applications. Redux separates the application data and business logic into its own container in order to let React manage just the view. Rather than a traditional library or a framework, it’s an application data-flow architecture. It is most compatible with Single Page Applications (SPAs) where the management of the states over time can get complex.

Redux was created by Dan Abramov and Andrew Clark around June 2015. It was inspired by Facebook’s Flux and influenced by functional programming language Elm. Redux got popular very quickly because of its simplicity, small size (only 2 KB) and great documentation.
